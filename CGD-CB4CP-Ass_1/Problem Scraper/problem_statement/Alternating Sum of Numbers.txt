Title: A. Alternating Sum of Numbers

Time Limit: time limit per test2 seconds
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Statement:
You are given a sequence of integers. Output the alternating sum of this sequence. In other words, output a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + a_5 - ... That is, the signs of plus and minus alternate, starting with a plus.

The first line of the test contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then follow t test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the length of the sequence. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, .., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).

Output t lines. For each test case, output the required alternating sum of the numbers.
