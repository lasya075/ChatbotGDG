Statement:
It's been a long summer's day, with the constant chirping of cicadas and the heat which never seemed to end. Finally, it has drawn to a close. The showdown has passed, the gates are open, and only a gentle breeze is left behind.

Your predecessors had taken their final bow; it's your turn to take the stage.

Sorting through some notes that were left behind, you found a curious statement named Problem 101 :

- Given a positive integer sequence a_1,a_2,...,a_n, you can operate on it any number of times. In an operation, you choose three consecutive elements a_i,a_{i+1},a_{i+2}, and merge them into one element \max(a_i+1,a_{i+1},a_{i+2}+1). Please calculate the maximum number of operations you can do without creating an element greater than m.
After some thought, you decided to propose the following problem, named Counting 101 :

- Given n and m. For each k=0,1,...,≤ft\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\right\rfloor, please find the number of integer sequences a_1,a_2,...,a_n with elements in [1, m], such that when used as input for Problem 101 , the answer is k. As the answer can be very large, please print it modulo 10^9+7.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤ t≤10^3). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n, m (1≤ n≤ 130, 1≤ m≤ 30).

For each test case, output ≤ft\lfloor\frac{n+1}{2}\right\rfloor numbers. The i-th number is the number of valid sequences such that when used as input for Problem 101 , the answer is i-1, modulo 10^9+7.

In the first test case, there are 2^3=8 candidate sequences. Among them, you can operate on [1,2,1] and [1,1,1] once; you cannot operate on the other 6 sequences.
