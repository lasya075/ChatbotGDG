Tutorial:
First of all, this task is the same as: "divide an array into two arrays with equal sum". So, obviously, we need to check if the sum of all elements is even which implies that the number of ones is even. Then, we can out half of 2s in one array and the other half in another, but if number of 2s is odd, then one array will have a greater sum then another, so we need to put two 1s there.

So, if we don't have two ones while the number of 2s is odd then the answer is "NO". Also, if sum is odd, the answer is also "NO". In all other cases, the answer is "YES".

C++ Code:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--)
    {
        int cnt1,cnt2;
        cin>>cnt1>>cnt2;
        if(cnt1%2)
        {
            cout<<"NO"<<endl;
        }
        else
        {
            if(cnt2%2==0)
            {
                cout<<"YES"<<endl;
            }
            else
            {
                if(cnt1==0)
                {
                    cout<<"NO"<<endl;
                }
                else
                {
                    cout<<"YES"<<endl;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
