Timofey is writing a competition called Capture the Flag (or CTF for short). He has one task left, which involves hacking a security system. The entire system is based on polynomial hashes∗.

Timofey can input a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters into the system, and the system will return its polynomial hash. To hack the system, Timofey needs to find the polynomial hash parameters (p and m) that the system uses.

Timofey doesn't have much time left, so he will only be able to make 3 queries. Help him solve the task.

∗ The polynomial hash of a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters of length n, based on p and modulo m is (\mathrm{ord}(s_1) · p ^ 0 + \mathrm{ord}(s_2) · p ^ 1 + \mathrm{ord}(s_3) · p ^ 2 + ... + \mathrm{ord}(s_n) · p ^ {n - 1}) \bmod m. Where s_i denotes the i-th character of the string s, \mathrm{ord}(\mathrm{chr}) denotes the ordinal number of the character \mathrm{chr} in the English alphabet, and x \bmod m is the remainder of x when divided by m.

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^3) — the number of test cases.

It is guaranteed that the p and m used by the system satisfy the conditions: 26 < p ≤q 50 and p + 1 < m ≤q 2 · 10^9.

To make a query to the system, output ? s, where s is a string of no more than 50 characters in length, the hash of which you want to know. In response to this query, you will receive the polynomial hash of the string s.

To output the answer, output ! p m, where p is the base of the hash, and m is the modulus. After that, immediately proceed to the next test case.

You have to make not more than 3 queries ? , otherwise you will get verdict Wrong Answer .

After outputting a query, do not forget to output a newline and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit exceeded . To flush the buffer, use:

-  fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;
-  System.out.flush() in Java;
-  flush(output) in Pascal;
-  stdout.flush() in Python;
- see the documentation for other languages.
Answer for the first query is (ord(a) · 31^0 + ord(a) · 31^1) \mod 59 = (1 + 1 · 31) \mod 59 = 32.

Answer for the second query is (ord(y) · 31^0 + ord(b) · 31^1) \mod 59 = (25 + 2 · 31) \mod 59 = 28.
